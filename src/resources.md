In this md, we show a few resources available for those interested in getting more familiar with deep learning

## Online resources

### Academic

**[Deep Learning book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville:**  
A nice self-contained book that starts presenting the required mathematical and machine learning knowledge in part I, then dwelves into modern deep networks in part II, and finishes by presenting a few open questions relevant do DL research.

**[Deep Learning and NLP course](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University:** the material of the course is available with pdfs for the suggested readings, codes and lecture notes.
The lectures are avilable in [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsGC3XXF1ThHwtDo18d7WVw) youtube channel.


### Videos and Courses
**[Udacity DL course](https://br.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730/) by Google:**  a well structured course that doesn't require a heavy math background. Mainly focused on TensorFlow

**[Neural Networks dismistified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs&list=PLiaHhY2iBX9hdHaRr6b7XevZtgZRa1PoU) by Stephen Whelch:** this series of videos is a fairly in depth but gentle introduction to neural networks.

**[Deep Learning TV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9OeZkIwhzfv-_Cb7fCikLQ/playlists):** Very pedagogical set of youtube videos on Deep Learning fundamentals, applications, librarires and plataforms.


### Aggregators:
**[Awesome Tensor Flow repo](https://github.com/jtoy/awesome-tensorflow):** this repo has a bunch of great resources for learning TensorFlow. There are tutorials, Models/Projects, Libraries, Videos, papers, blogposts, communities, books, etc. 

**[Nice Quora question](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-resources-to-learn-about-deep-learning)** with a bunch of resources

**[Another Quora question](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-books-papers-for-learning-deep-learning):** more focused on academic resources

**[Relevant DL papers](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/The-9-Deep-Learning-Papers-You-Need-To-Know-About.html):** 9 relevant recent papers in computer vision and neural networks.

**[Awesome Deep Learning repo](https://github.com/ChristosChristofidis/awesome-deep-learning):** a repo of resources much much much better then what we could ever hope to achieve. A bunch of great stuff here, really :D
